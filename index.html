      <p>An inoperable escalator or elevator is an inconvenience commuters have to contend with when using the metrorail system.  To many, it seems as if these outages happen all the time.  But, do they really?<p>

      <p>Here is a representation of the number of escalator and elevator outages by month for the year 2017.  As you can see, escalators experience outages at a far higher occurrence than elevators.  However, there are over twice as many escalators than elevators in metrorail stations.<p>

      <p>If you've ever wondered where outages occur most, the reference the following map.<p>

      <p>As evidenced by the map, outages occur far more often within city limits and in some of the busiest stations in the metro area.  For instance, the average weekly passenger boardings for Dupont Circle was 16,948 in 2017, as opposed to 5,557 for Van Ness-UDC (source: WMATA Public Records).<p>

      <p>It is also important to take into account the nature of the data, which counts outages per unit <i>within</i> a station.<p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.wmata.com/service/elevators-escalators/outage-types.cfm"> WMATA</a>, preventive maintenance inspections are conducted at regular intervals.  However, some stations receive inspections more often than others.  Interestingly, though Van Ness had over 11,000 fewer daily patrons than Dupont Circle, it appears inspections were conducted more often at this station.<p>
